# EC440 Projects

Welcome to my operating systems portfolio! This repo is a collection of hands-on projects where I dive into the core concepts that make operating systems tick. Each project tackles a key part of how modern OSes work, from running programs to managing memory and files.

**Here’s what I’m working on:**
1. **Shell (system calls)** – A simple shell that lets you interact with the OS directly through system calls (currently in progress).
2. **Threads** – Exploring how parallel execution works and how the OS schedules threads to run efficiently.
3. **Synchronization** – Using semaphores and other tools to handle concurrent processes and avoid race conditions.
4. **Memory** – Implementing virtual memory systems and working with shared memory to see how the OS manages limited resources.
5. **File Systems** – Digging into how file systems work and building parts of one to manage data storage.
